After enough discussions with people on dotfiles, I decided to publish mine. I don't think anything in here is particularly spectacular, and most of this was copy-pasta'd from other dotfile repos. 

Here's some of my preferences:
 * Dvorak
 * minimal/no icons
 * solarized-light scheme

I'm running this on arch, with xmonad. You'll see some files from programs I once-used, and no longer use. In those cases, your mileage may vary, as these files may be out of date, and not functional.

Here's my keyboard configs, :
 * https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/p7E9R/latest/0
 * system76-keyboard-configurator for lemp10 (see the 'system/system76-keyboard-configurator-lemp10.json')

NOTE:
 * There are a lot of hard-coded references to my name, and home directory path.
 * the system/ folder... doesn't know what it wants to be yet. But, these are files that exist outside of home

Install:
  * Check out the repo
  * `git submodule` init and `git submodule` update
  * make all (or manually choose to stow what you want)
