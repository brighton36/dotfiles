#+TITLE: brighton36's dotfiles ðŸ“„

After enough discussions with people on dotfiles, I decided to publish mine. I don't think anything in here is particularly spectacular, and most of this was copy-pasta'd from other dotfile repos.

I guess what makes these marginally unique are my general preference towards: dvorak, minimal to no icons, solarized-light. You'll see these values, along with a generally consistent set of key bindings across files.

** NOTES
- There are a lot of hard-coded references to my name, and home directory path.
- the system/ folder... doesn't know what it wants to be yet. But, these are files that exist outside of home
- I'm running this on arch, with xmonad. You'll see some files from programs I once-used, and no longer use. In those cases, your mileage may vary, as these files may be out of date, and not functional.
- There's a lot of references to my IRL name throughout these files. You'll want to change that.

* How to Install ðŸ’»
These instructions will setup your home directory.
- Check out the repo
- Run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update`
- make all (or manually choose to stow what you want)

* Supplemental config files
These are installed outside your home directory, and that's not handled by the below install instructions
- Built-in Laptop Keyboard [[https://github.com/brighton36/dotfiles/blob/main/system/system76-keyboard-configurator-lemp10.json][system/system76-keyboard-configurator-lemp10.json]]
- External USB Moonlander Keyboard - [[https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/p7E9R][brighton36's Moonlander - lemp10]]
- A caps-to-control tty map [[https://github.com/brighton36/dotfiles/blob/main/system/dvorak-chris.map][/usr/local/share/kbd/keymaps/dvorak-chris.map]] (with a corresponding [[https://github.com/brighton36/dotfiles/blob/main/system/vconsole.conf][/etc/vconsole.conf]])
- The very-excellent interception config for installation into [[https://github.com/brighton36/dotfiles/tree/main/system/interception][/etc/interception]] (NOTE: I've recently switched to xremap on wayland)

* System Notes ðŸ“š
I guess this is like, a TODO list of 'things to maybe include here in the future'.
- My modified lightdm.conf...
- I manually created a powertop service using: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Powertop
- I needed xmobar to compile with dynamic libs enabled, which, I use the `xmobar-dynamic aur package` for.
- I use a script in /usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep/brightness to set resume/wake brightness
