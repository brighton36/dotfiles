#+TITLE: brighton36's dotfiles ðŸ“„

These are my dotfiles, calibrated for use on arch. Though, in most cases, they're portable elsewhere. Some of these files are from programs I used in the past, and moved off of, and are no longer well maintained. Nonetheless, I keep them around in case I return to those programs in the future.

I guess what makes my dotfiles unique are my general preference towards: dvorak, minimal-to-no icons, solarized-light. You'll see these values, along with a generally consistent set of key bindings across files.

** NOTES
- There are a lot of hard-coded references to my name, and home directory path. You'll want to change that.
- the system/ folder... doesn't know what it wants to be yet. But, these are files that exist outside of home, in use on my machine.
- There's a lot of references to my IRL name throughout these files. You'll want to change that.

* How to Install ðŸ’»
These instructions will setup your home directory.
- Check out the repo
- Run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update`. The repo is now ready to deploy.
- My dotfiles are grouped into the following categories: emacs, shell, tmux, vim, wayland, X.
- If you want to quickly deploy a category, into your home (say 'wayland'), here's the command to do that: `stow --verbose --target=$HOME --restow wayland`
- Or, if you want to deploy everything, just run `make all` in the root of the repo.

* Supplemental config files
These are installed outside your home directory, and that's not handled by the below install instructions
- Built-in Laptop Keyboard [[https://github.com/brighton36/dotfiles/blob/main/system/system76-keyboard-configurator-lemp10.json][system/system76-keyboard-configurator-lemp10.json]]
- External USB Moonlander Keyboard - [[https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/p7E9R][brighton36's Moonlander - lemp10]]
- A caps-to-control tty map [[https://github.com/brighton36/dotfiles/blob/main/system/dvorak-chris.map][/usr/local/share/kbd/keymaps/dvorak-chris.map]] (with a corresponding [[https://github.com/brighton36/dotfiles/blob/main/system/vconsole.conf][/etc/vconsole.conf]])
- My nterception config for installation into [[https://github.com/brighton36/dotfiles/tree/main/system/interception][/etc/interception]] (Though I've recently deprecated interception in lieu of xremap on wayland)

* System Notes ðŸ“š
I guess this is like, a TODO list of 'things to maybe include here in the future'.
- My modified lightdm.conf...
- I manually created a powertop service using: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Powertop
- I needed xmobar to compile with dynamic libs enabled, which, I use the `xmobar-dynamic aur package` for.
- I use a script in /usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep/brightness to set resume/wake brightness
