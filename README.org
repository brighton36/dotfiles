After enough discussions with people on dotfiles, I decided to publish mine. I don't think anything in here is particularly spectacular, and most of this was copy-pasta'd from other dotfile repos. 

Here's some of my preferences:
* Dvorak
* minimal icons
* solarized-light scheme

I'm running this on arch, with xmonad. You'll see some files from programs I once-used, and no longer use. In those cases, your mileage may vary, as these files may be out of date, and not functional.

NOTE:
 * There are a lot of hard-coded references to my name, and home directory path.
 * the system/ folder... doesn't know what it wants to be yet. But, these are files that exist outside of home

TODO: 
  * Mention the need to git submodule init and git submodule update
