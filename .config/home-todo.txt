Priority:

* emacs
  * I'm not crazy about that current-linegreen, mostly because it's even garish
  * ctrl-r to 'SPACE b b'
  * Cmake syntax highlighting
  * ALways turn on line numbers (those sql files weren't line'd)
  * Can we dim out the background window, the way we do in tmux...
    * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33195122/highlight-current-active-window
  with fish. Let's make it gray or light brown instead.
  * Understand M-x dedicated-mode
  * gmail might be nice...

* Those dunst modal colors could be better..

* vim
  * see that todo wrt escape in the vimrc
  * Can we maybe do a 'search for buffer' with ctrl-r?

* xmonad
  * Can we center modal / file-chooser dialogs ?
    leave us hjkl for resize and move operations
  * Urgency... seems to work, but there's something weird going on there...
    * At the least, let's get rid of those control codes
	* Moving/resizing windows with the keyboard might be good:
		* https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.17.0/docs/XMonad-Actions-FloatKeys.html
		* Maybe using hjkl with a modifier... meta-alt to move, meta-control to resize?
  * Maybe Look into using statusbar instead of the mobar sleep weirdness:
    https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.16/docs/XMonad-Hooks-DynamicLog.html#v:statusBar
    hmm: https://xmonad.github.io/xmonad-docs/xmonad-contrib/XMonad-Hooks-StatusBar.html#g:5

tmux:
  Maybe ctrl-tab?

System Notes:
  * the /usr/local/share/kbd/keymaps/dvorak-chris.map and /etc/vconsole.conf and lightdm.conf... isn't in the config
  * On the laptop, we manually created a powertop service: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Powertop
