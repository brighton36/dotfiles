Priority:

* Telegram
  * ctrl-w isn't working...
  * ctrl-a isn't working...
  * ctrl-h and ctrl-d...
* emacs
  * Why doesnt M-[/] work in vterm...
  * We're having a problem atm with txt files not opening in text-mode.
    they're opening 'Fundamental'. This is causing our line numbers to not show
    (M-x text-mode seems to fix that...)
  * *maybe* Understand M-x dedicated-mode (I think we fixed our window issues)
  * Window resize using ctrl-shift-< and ctrl-shift->

* fish
  * Can we get ctrl-b and ctrl-f working in insert mode...

* Those dunst modal colors could be better..
* maybe try picom again... or even picom-jonaburg-fix?
  * Shadows would be nice...

* xmonad
  * Autokey added a tray icon, which is why the power is getting clipped
  * Something weird is happening with windows appearing on workspaces that they shouldnt
    * maybe this is a bug in the bleeding edge? maybe it's because we don't have desktop backgrounds..

	* Moving/resizing windows with the keyboard might be good:
		* https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.17.0/docs/XMonad-Actions-FloatKeys.html
		* Maybe using hjkl with a modifier... meta-alt to move, meta-control to resize?

* maybe we should be using ctrl-o andn ctrl-i more... instead of ctrl-n annd ctrl-p
  * It's already the default on firefox...

tmux:
  * Maybe ctrl-tab?
  * https://superuser.com/questions/493048/how-to-convert-2-horizontal-panes-to-vertical-panes-in-tmux
  * Some kind of tab-next tab-prev (meta-shift-[/]?

* vim
  * see that todo wrt escape in the vimrc
  * Can we maybe do a 'search for buffer' with ctrl-s?

System Notes:
