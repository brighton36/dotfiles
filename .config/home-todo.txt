Priority:

* Mod4  + ,aeo  should map to up/down/left/rigght
  * Rebind the o then, I guess

* emacs
  * Indentation is weird sometimes.... editing ruby... otherwise...
  * That edit server would be nice in there. it's commented out currently.
    * It logs 'done' before showing a window of any kind...
    * Be sure to add the script if you get it worknig...
    * And float it in xmonady https://parasurv.neocities.org/emacs/edit-browser-textarea-with-emacs.html
  * Maybe: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/22437/open-set-of-buffers-based-on-git-branch

* Maybe we can assign shortcuts to gmail desktop, to make it awesome
  * Let's just see if the greasemonkey can be made to work first...
  * If not, maybe try to autohotkey a google-desktop the way we did slack...

* Bluetooth hsp mode:
  https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/bluetooth_headset#Switch_between_HSP/HFP_and_A2DP_setting
  * Maybe try this out to see the bluetooth battery:
    https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/bluetooth_headset#Battery_level_reporting
    https://github.com/TheWeirdDev/Bluetooth_Headset_Battery_Level
    https://www.reddit.com/r/pipewire/comments/pcjkls/bluetooth_battery_status/

* xmobar
  * Move the dunst upper right a bit
  * Maybe stack-static will fix the buggy xmobar:
    https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Haskell#stack-static
    You may be able to go back to the non-dynamic xmobar package at that time...
  * What about that Unsafe... can we make it safer? Maybe this will fix the xmobar crash..

* Keybindings:
  * Bind Bluetooth off to F11?
	* Moving/resizing float windows with the keyboard might be good:
		* https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.17.0/docs/XMonad-Actions-FloatKeys.html
		* Maybe using hjkl with a modifier... meta-alt to move, meta-control to resize?
		* Or just going with the emacs keys of </> and o/e

  * Maybe function + gcr,htn,mwv for numpad

---------------------

System Notes:
  * the /usr/local/share/kbd/keymaps/dvorak-chris.map and /etc/vconsole.conf and lightdm.conf... isn't in the config
  * On the laptop, we manually created a powertop service: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Powertop
  * Note that we needed xmobar to compile with dynamic libs enabled, which, we use the
    xmobar-dynamic aur package for
