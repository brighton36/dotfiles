Priority:


* Keybindings:
  * tap ctrl for escape?
  * Bind Bluetooth off to F11?
  * Maybe function key + hjkl should map to up/down/left/rigght
    * Or maybe just the meta/ctrl there on the lower left
    * Firefox needs a word-right and word-left (ctrl-right, ctrl-left) nearer to the home row
	* Moving/resizing windows with the keyboard might be good:
		* https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.17.0/docs/XMonad-Actions-FloatKeys.html
		* Maybe using hjkl with a modifier... meta-alt to move, meta-control to resize?
  * Maybe function + gcr,htn,mwv for numpad

* emacs
  * Tabs are weird sometimes.... editing ruby... otherwise...
  * maybe use alt-n and alt-p for tabs in emacs
  * Stop the cwd fuckery:
  * :bd closes the window, instead of just the buffer
    * Meanwhile, SPC-b-d does exactly what we want. Maybe just remap this?
  * Alt-space would be useful for a layout rotation
  * Why doesnt M-[/] work in vterm...
  * We're having a problem atm with txt files not opening in text-mode.
    they're opening 'Fundamental'. This is causing our line numbers to not show
    (M-x text-mode seems to fix that...)
  * Window resize using ctrl-shift-< and ctrl-shift->

* Firefox
  * ctrl-shift-backspace : undo close tab

* xmonad
  * Those dunst modal colors could be better..
  * Are the wallpapers randomly cycling? no.
  * Test the vol icon with the levels. I think we have shit levels
  * I think flashfocus needs to restart in the config, in the same way the tray does...
  * What about that Unsafe... can we make it safer?

* maybe we should be using ctrl-o andn ctrl-i more... instead of ctrl-n annd ctrl-p
  * It's already the default on firefox...

---------------------

System Notes:
  * the /usr/local/share/kbd/keymaps/dvorak-chris.map and /etc/vconsole.conf and lightdm.conf... isn't in the config
  * On the laptop, we manually created a powertop service: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Powertop
  * Note that we needed xmobar to compile with dynamic libs enabled, which, we use the
    xmobar-dynamic aur package for
