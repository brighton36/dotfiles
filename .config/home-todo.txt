Priority:

* Add the .mbsyncrc file, but, remove the password from the repo, use passcmd
* I think standardizing the resize, as ctl-shift-<>/<> in tmux/emacs/xmonad is prudent

* Maybe add the email sync systemd stuff once we figure out how we're going to update emails

* xmonad:
  * I think this is the issue with startup xmobar crashing:
   https://reddit.com/r/xmonad/comments/xciq2d/an_issue_ive_found_with_xmobar_alsa_plugin/

	* Address the todo's in the xmonad.hs
  * Maybe this: https://tony-zorman.com/posts/orgmode-prompt/2022-08-27-xmonad-and-org-mode.html

* Fish : Does ctrl-k not work?

* tmux
  * When there's a bell on a tab, that's not the current tab, that shouldn't change the color
  of the alert tab. That should put an asterisk to it maybe. it's confusing atm, because
  you can't tell what tab you're in, in that case

* emacs
  * Get the telega unread messages count more readable:
    the face is: telega-muted-count
    * from the chat: You can use ~describe-face~ to get their font face. Then modify the face to your liking.
  * telega edit isn't worknig right with doom-emacs. rebind the telega-msg-edit to maybe ctrl-shift-e
  * Window resize needs left/right and up/down do  c->, c-<, c-shift->, and c-shift-<
  * That edit server would be nice in there. it's commented out currently.
    * The keyboard shortcut in firefox isn't working
    * How do we save/send-to-firefox
    * And float it in xmonady https://parasurv.neocities.org/emacs/edit-browser-textarea-with-emacs.html
  * Maybe insert emoji by binding to insert-char or emojify (get page-up/page-down working )
  * https://solargraph.org/
  * evil-shift-right (visual select) then < and >  doesn't tab the way we want. Or even the way the 'tab' key works
    * Is this fixed? if not try one of:
    * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8473131/set-the-evil-shift-width-to-the-buffer-local-indentation-in-emacs
    * https://www.reddit.com/r/DoomEmacs/comments/i2atvp/using_tab_to_align_code_in_normal_state/
	* A layout adjustment... like xmonad mod4-space, or something like tmux's alt-1/2/etc function..

* Bluetooth hsp mode:
  https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/bluetooth_headset#Switch_between_HSP/HFP_and_A2DP_setting
  * Maybe try this out to see the bluetooth battery:
    https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/bluetooth_headset#Battery_level_reporting
    https://github.com/TheWeirdDev/Bluetooth_Headset_Battery_Level
    https://www.reddit.com/r/pipewire/comments/pcjkls/bluetooth_battery_status/

* xmobar
  * Maybe stack-static will fix the buggy xmobar:
    https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Haskell#stack-static
    You may be able to go back to the non-dynamic xmobar package at that time...
  * What about that Unsafe... can we make it safer?

* Maybe we should round the corners of our screenshots:
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/718314/rounding-corners-of-pictures-with-imagemagick

* Keybindings:
  * Bind Bluetooth off to F11?
	* Moving/resizing float windows with the keyboard might be good:
		* https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.17.0/docs/XMonad-Actions-FloatKeys.html
		* Maybe using hjkl with a modifier... meta-alt to move, meta-control to resize?
			* Yeah, and, I'm thinking we can use this same thing for pane resize in emacs/tmux
		* Or just going with the emacs keys of </> and o/e
  * Maybe function + gcr,htn,mwv for numpad

---------------------

System Notes:
  * the /usr/local/share/kbd/keymaps/dvorak-chris.map and /etc/vconsole.conf and lightdm.conf... isn't in the config
  * On the laptop, we manually created a powertop service: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Powertop
  * Note that we needed xmobar to compile with dynamic libs enabled, which, we use the
    xmobar-dynamic aur package for
  * We use a script in /usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep/brightness to set resume/wake brightness
