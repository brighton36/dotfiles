Priority:

* Telegram
  * ctrl-w isn't working...
  * ctrl-a isn't working...
  * ctrl-h and ctrl-d...
* emacs
  * Why doesnt M-[/] work in vterm...
  * We're having a problem atm with txt files not opening in text-mode.
    they're opening 'Fundamental'. This is causing our line numbers to not show
    (M-x text-mode seems to fix that...)
  * *maybe* Understand M-x dedicated-mode (I think we fixed our window issues)
  * Window resize using ctrl-shift-< and ctrl-shift->

* fish
  * Can we get ctrl-b and ctrl-f working in insert mode...

* Those dunst modal colors could be better..
* maybe try picom again... or even picom-jonaburg-fix?
  * Shadows would be nice...

* xmonad
  * Urgency... seems to work, but there's something weird going on there...
    * At the least, let's get rid of those control codes
		* Lets do this: https://xmonad.github.io/xmonad-docs/xmonad-contrib/XMonad-Hooks-StatusBar.html
    * Ok, I think we need to switch to https://xmonad.github.io/xmonad-docs/xmonad-contrib-0.16.999/XMonad-Util-ClickableWorkspaces.html
      * Because our implementation is what's causing this
      * Test it by running: sleep 1; echo -e "\a"
  * Autokey added a tray icon, which is why the power is getting clipped
  * Something weird is happening with windows appearing on workspaces that they shouldnt
    * maybe this is a bug in the bleeding edge?

	* Moving/resizing windows with the keyboard might be good:
		* https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.17.0/docs/XMonad-Actions-FloatKeys.html
		* Maybe using hjkl with a modifier... meta-alt to move, meta-control to resize?
  * Maybe Look into using statusbar instead of the mobar sleep weirdness:
    https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.16/docs/XMonad-Hooks-DynamicLog.html#v:statusBar

* maybe we should be using ctrl-o andn ctrl-i more... instead of ctrl-n annd ctrl-p
  * It's already the default on firefox...

tmux:
  * Maybe ctrl-tab?
  * https://superuser.com/questions/493048/how-to-convert-2-horizontal-panes-to-vertical-panes-in-tmux
  * Some kind of tab-next tab-prev (meta-shift-[/]?

* vim
  * see that todo wrt escape in the vimrc
  * Can we maybe do a 'search for buffer' with ctrl-s?


---------------------

System Notes:
  * the /usr/local/share/kbd/keymaps/dvorak-chris.map and /etc/vconsole.conf and lightdm.conf... isn't in the config
  * On the laptop, we manually created a powertop service: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Powertop
