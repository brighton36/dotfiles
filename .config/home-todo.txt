Priority:

* I think standardizing the resize, as ctl-shift-<>/<> in tmux/emacs/xmonad is prudent
  * And it should almost certainly be ctrl-shift-hjkl

* Fix the xcape by using intercept-tools and caps2esc:
  * https://gitlab.com/interception/linux/tools

* Fish : Does ctrl-k not work? And, maybe we should match these shortcuts a bit better to emacs

* tmux
  * When there's a bell on a tab, that's not the current tab, that shouldn't change the color
  of the alert tab. That should put an asterisk to it maybe. it's confusing atm, because
  you can't tell what tab you're in, in that case

* emacs
  * Word wrap in telega messages would be nice
  * emacs everywhere server would be nice. it's commented out currently.
    * The keyboard shortcut in firefox isn't working
    * How do we save/send-to-firefox
    * And float it in xmonady https://parasurv.neocities.org/emacs/edit-browser-textarea-with-emacs.html
  * Add these: https://github.com/DarthFennec/highlight-indent-guides
  * https://github.com/abo-abo/avy
    * Maybe use that avy-goto-char-timer
    * From https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33134113
    * I'm thinking ctrl-g
    * We should have a goto-line number too
  * maybe remove the ctrl-t for tabnew
  * Window resize needs left/right and up/down do  c->, c-<, c-shift->, and c-shift-<
  * Maybe insert emoji by binding to insert-char or emojify (get page-up/page-down working )
  * https://solargraph.org/
  * evil-shift-right (visual select) then < and >  doesn't tab the way we want. Or even the way the 'tab' key works
    * Is this fixed? if not try one of:

    * https://www.reddit.com/r/DoomEmacs/comments/i2atvp/using_tab_to_align_code_in_normal_state/
  * EVentually we're going to want to GTD this: https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/GTD/index.html
	* A layout adjustment... like xmonad mod4-space, or something like tmux's alt-1/2/etc function..
  * Eventually a GTD:

* Let's maybe switch to a modal keyboard pointer:
  - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33221901
  - https://github.com/rvaiya/warpd

* xmonad:
  * Add support for emoji pop-up:
    - https://github.com/jchook/emoji-menu
	* Address the todo's in the xmonad.hs
  * Maybe this: https://tony-zorman.com/posts/orgmode-prompt/2022-08-27-xmonad-and-org-mode.html
  * xmobar: What about that Unsafe... can we make it safer?

* Bluetooth hsp mode:
  https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/bluetooth_headset#Switch_between_HSP/HFP_and_A2DP_setting
  * Maybe try this out to see the bluetooth battery:
    https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/bluetooth_headset#Battery_level_reporting
    https://github.com/TheWeirdDev/Bluetooth_Headset_Battery_Level
    https://www.reddit.com/r/pipewire/comments/pcjkls/bluetooth_battery_status/

* Maybe we should round the corners of our screenshots:
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/718314/rounding-corners-of-pictures-with-imagemagick

* Keybindings:
  * Bind Bluetooth off to F11?
	* Moving/resizing float windows with the keyboard might be good:

---------------------

System Notes:
  * the /usr/local/share/kbd/keymaps/dvorak-chris.map and /etc/vconsole.conf and lightdm.conf... isn't in the config
  * On the laptop, we manually created a powertop service: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Powertop
  * Note that we needed xmobar to compile with dynamic libs enabled, which, we use the
    xmobar-dynamic aur package for
  * We use a script in /usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep/brightness to set resume/wake brightness
