Priority:

* Add the .mbsyncrc file, but, remove the password from the repo, use passcmd
* Maybe start adding the kiavi/stow dotfiles
* I think standardizing the resize, as ctl-shift-hjkl in tmux/emacs/xmonad is prudent
* Or I can use hjkl for arrows: left, down, up right

* xmonad:
	* Address the todo's in the xmonad.hs
* picom:
  * No shadow for full screen apps

* emacs
  * Maybe this: https://tony-zorman.com/posts/orgmode-prompt/2022-08-27-xmonad-and-org-mode.html
  * the (visual select) then < and >  doesn't tab the way we want. Or even the way the 'tab' key works
    * https://www.reddit.com/r/DoomEmacs/comments/i2atvp/using_tab_to_align_code_in_normal_state/
	* A layout adjustment... like xmonad mod4-space, or something like tmux's alt-1/2/etc function..
  * That edit server would be nice in there. it's commented out currently.
    * The keyboard shortcut in firefox isn't working
    * How do we save/send-to-firefox
    * And float it in xmonady https://parasurv.neocities.org/emacs/edit-browser-textarea-with-emacs.html
  * Maybe: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/22437/open-set-of-buffers-based-on-git-branch

* Bluetooth hsp mode:
  https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/bluetooth_headset#Switch_between_HSP/HFP_and_A2DP_setting
  * Maybe try this out to see the bluetooth battery:
    https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/bluetooth_headset#Battery_level_reporting
    https://github.com/TheWeirdDev/Bluetooth_Headset_Battery_Level
    https://www.reddit.com/r/pipewire/comments/pcjkls/bluetooth_battery_status/

* xmobar
  * Maybe stack-static will fix the buggy xmobar:
    https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Haskell#stack-static
    You may be able to go back to the non-dynamic xmobar package at that time...
  * What about that Unsafe... can we make it safer?

* Keybindings:
  * Bind Bluetooth off to F11?
	* Moving/resizing float windows with the keyboard might be good:
		* https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.17.0/docs/XMonad-Actions-FloatKeys.html
		* Maybe using hjkl with a modifier... meta-alt to move, meta-control to resize?
			* Yeah, and, I'm thinking we can use this same thing for pane resize in emacs/tmux
		* Or just going with the emacs keys of </> and o/e
  * Maybe function + gcr,htn,mwv for numpad

---------------------

System Notes:
  * the /usr/local/share/kbd/keymaps/dvorak-chris.map and /etc/vconsole.conf and lightdm.conf... isn't in the config
  * On the laptop, we manually created a powertop service: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Powertop
  * Note that we needed xmobar to compile with dynamic libs enabled, which, we use the
    xmobar-dynamic aur package for
  * We use a script in /usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep/brightness to set resume/wake brightness
