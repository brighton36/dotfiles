Priority:

* emacs
  * Tabs are weird sometimes.... editing ruby... otherwise...
  * maybe use alt-n and alt-p for tabs in emacs
  * maybe use ctrl-[/] to navigate the file tabs at the top
  * Stop the cwd fuckery:
  * :bd closes the window, instead of just the buffer
    * Meanwhile, SPC-b-d does exactly what we want. Maybe just remap this?
  https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/22437/open-set-of-buffers-based-on-git-branch
  * Alt-space would be useful for a layout rotation
  * Why doesnt M-[/] work in vterm...
  * We're having a problem atm with txt files not opening in text-mode.
    they're opening 'Fundamental'. This is causing our line numbers to not show
    (M-x text-mode seems to fix that...)
  * Window resize using ctrl-shift-< and ctrl-shift->

* Get this working with xmonad and firefox:
  https://parasurv.neocities.org/emacs/edit-browser-textarea-with-emacs.html

* Resume from hibernate needs to 100% the brightness

* Maybe we can assign shortcuts to gmail desktop, to make it awesome

* Bluetooth hsp mode:
  https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/bluetooth_headset#Switch_between_HSP/HFP_and_A2DP_setting
* Maybe try this out to see the bluetooth battery:
https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/bluetooth_headset#Battery_level_reporting
https://github.com/TheWeirdDev/Bluetooth_Headset_Battery_Level
https://www.reddit.com/r/pipewire/comments/pcjkls/bluetooth_battery_status/

* Keyboaard:
  * maybe set these layout settings in the X config:
  https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xorg/Keyboard_configuration#Using_X_configuration_files
  so that it applies when a new keyboard is attached

* xmobar
  * Move the dunst upper right a bit
  * Maybe stack-static will fix the buggy xmobar:
    https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Haskell#stack-static
    You may be able to go back to the non-dynamic xmobar package at that time...
  * What about that Unsafe... can we make it safer? Maybe this will fix the xmobar crash..

* Todo: adjust the screenshot app to remove the colons (for jira)

* picom:
  * Try out this snazzy animations fork: picom-animations-git
    https://github.com/PhyTech-R0/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/picom/picom.conf


* Keybindings:
  * Bind Bluetooth off to F11?
  * Maybe function key + ,eau  should map to up/down/left/rigght
    * Or maybe just the meta/ctrl there on the lower left
    * I guess the apple karabiner has right-command+hjkl as an option
	* Moving/resizing windows with the keyboard might be good:
		* https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.17.0/docs/XMonad-Actions-FloatKeys.html
		* Maybe using hjkl with a modifier... meta-alt to move, meta-control to resize?
  * Maybe function + gcr,htn,mwv for numpad

* maybe we should be using ctrl-o andn ctrl-i more... instead of ctrl-n annd ctrl-p
  * It's already the default on firefox...

---------------------

System Notes:
  * the /usr/local/share/kbd/keymaps/dvorak-chris.map and /etc/vconsole.conf and lightdm.conf... isn't in the config
  * On the laptop, we manually created a powertop service: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Powertop
  * Note that we needed xmobar to compile with dynamic libs enabled, which, we use the
    xmobar-dynamic aur package for
