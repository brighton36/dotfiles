Priority:

* fish
  * Can we get ctrl-b and ctrl-f working in insert mode...

* tmux:
  * Let's dim the background pane better... with a gray background?
  * Something better to navigate through the tabs (alt-n/p?)
  * alt-space? https://superuser.com/questions/493048/how-to-convert-2-horizontal-panes-to-vertical-panes-in-tmux

* xmonad
  * And/or https://www.reddit.com/r/xmonad/comments/t1v3e2/i_cannot_load_icon_fonts_nerd_fonts_on_xmobar/
  * Naming the workspaces instead of using numbers might be a good idea
  * Bind Bluetooth off to F11?
  * What about that Unsafe... can we make it safer?
  * Wallpapers per-desktop maybe and workspace names https://xmonad.github.io/xmonad-docs/xmonad-contrib/XMonad-Hooks-WallpaperSetter.html
  * Those dunst modal colors could be better..
  * Maybe function key + hjkl should map to up/down/left/rigght
    * Firefox needs a word-right and word-left (ctrl-right, ctrl-left) nearer to the home row
	* Moving/resizing windows with the keyboard might be good:
		* https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.17.0/docs/XMonad-Actions-FloatKeys.html
		* Maybe using hjkl with a modifier... meta-alt to move, meta-control to resize?

* emacs
  * Ctrl-p and ctrl-n won't work for the tab switch. Because we use that for page up/down
  * Why doesnt M-[/] work in vterm...
  * We're having a problem atm with txt files not opening in text-mode.
    they're opening 'Fundamental'. This is causing our line numbers to not show
    (M-x text-mode seems to fix that...)
  * *maybe* Understand M-x dedicated-mode (I think we fixed our window issues)
  * Window resize using ctrl-shift-< and ctrl-shift->

* maybe we should be using ctrl-o andn ctrl-i more... instead of ctrl-n annd ctrl-p
  * It's already the default on firefox...

---------------------

System Notes:
  * the /usr/local/share/kbd/keymaps/dvorak-chris.map and /etc/vconsole.conf and lightdm.conf... isn't in the config
  * On the laptop, we manually created a powertop service: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Powertop
