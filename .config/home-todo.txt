Priority:

* emacs
  * We're having a problem atm with txt files not opening in text-mode.
    they're opening 'Fundamental'. This is causing our line numbers to not show
    (M-x text-mode seems to fix that...)
  * *maybe* Understand M-x dedicated-mode (I think we fixed our window issues)

* fish
  * Can we get ctrl-b and ctrl-f working in insert mode...

* Those dunst modal colors could be better..

* vim
  * see that todo wrt escape in the vimrc
  * Can we maybe do a 'search for buffer' with ctrl-s?

* xmonad
  * Urgency... seems to work, but there's something weird going on there...
    * At the least, let's get rid of those control codes
	* Moving/resizing windows with the keyboard might be good:
		* https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.17.0/docs/XMonad-Actions-FloatKeys.html
		* Maybe using hjkl with a modifier... meta-alt to move, meta-control to resize?
  * Maybe Look into using statusbar instead of the mobar sleep weirdness:
    https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.16/docs/XMonad-Hooks-DynamicLog.html#v:statusBar
    hmm: https://xmonad.github.io/xmonad-docs/xmonad-contrib/XMonad-Hooks-StatusBar.html#g:5

tmux:
  * Maybe ctrl-tab?
  * https://superuser.com/questions/493048/how-to-convert-2-horizontal-panes-to-vertical-panes-in-tmux
  * Some kind of tab-next tab-prev (meta-shift-[/]?


---------------------

System Notes:
  * the /usr/local/share/kbd/keymaps/dvorak-chris.map and /etc/vconsole.conf and lightdm.conf... isn't in the config
  * On the laptop, we manually created a powertop service: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Powertop
