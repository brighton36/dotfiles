Priority:
  -- See the telegram and chrome todo's in the xmonad.hs, figure out why we're weird there
  * Get that ~/bin/volume_change.sh working, and put it into your xmonad

* vim
  * see that todo wrt escape in the vimrc
  * Can we maybe do a 'search for buffer' with ctrl-r?

* It'd be nice to not use the arrow keys for terminal history (up and down in fish)
  * Maybe ctrl-n and ctrl-p?

* Firefox, maybe a tridacty key for undo close?
  * and maybe set d/u (without modifier) as down/up..

* xmonad
  * Ctrl-n and ctrl-p might be better than hl for workspaces. And that can
  * Can we center modal / file-chooser dialogs ?
    leave us hjkl for resize and move operations
  * Urgency... seems to work, but there's something weird going on there...
    * At the least, let's get rid of those control codes
	* Moving/resizing windows with the keyboard might be good:
		* https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.17.0/docs/XMonad-Actions-FloatKeys.html
		* Maybe using hjkl with a modifier... meta-alt to move, meta-control to resize?
  * Maybe Look into using statusbar instead of the mobar sleep weirdness:
    https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.16/docs/XMonad-Hooks-DynamicLog.html#v:statusBar
    hmm: https://xmonad.github.io/xmonad-docs/xmonad-contrib/XMonad-Hooks-StatusBar.html#g:5

* I think we'd like to disable the arrow keys in Xf86. Try to use emacs keys instead...
  * kmonad may work here. Look into ctrl-hold/ctrl-tap-escape here in kmonad

tmux:
  Maybe ctrl-tab?

System Notes:
  * the /usr/local/share/kbd/keymaps/dvorak-chris.map and /etc/vconsole.conf and lightdm.conf... isn't in the config
  * On the laptop, we manually created a powertop service: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Powertop
